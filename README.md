**Adaptive AI** is a personalized AI-driven learning platform that tailors course recommendations based on user progress and engagement. It uses a **collaborative filtering recommendation model** built with **PyTorch** to analyze user interactions and suggest relevant courses. The platform integrates **Django** for backend services and **React with Bootstrap** for an interactive frontend. It includes a **dashboard**, **user profile management**, and a **leaderboard** to enhance engagement through gamification. The system leverages **machine learning** to provide a dynamic and adaptive learning experience, making education more effective and engaging. This project is designed for scalable and intelligent learning solutions.
